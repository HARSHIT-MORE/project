        DU has a lot of student societies that conduct a lot of events every
        year, but most of them face difficulties while getting the event
        sponsored to make it more awesome and engage more students. We aim to
        solve this issue by creating a centralised platform where these
        societies can either raise funds or find sponsors who are willing to
        sponsor their awesome events.
